The primary goal of this project was to develop an automated solution for converting active sentences to passive sentences using Prolog and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system employed a three-step process based on Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) to identify the input sentence representation, determine the corresponding target sentence representation, and generate the output sentence. Additionally, the project aimed to improve efficiency and conciseness by categorizing the 12 different tenses into four groups based on the presence of auxiliary verbs, which significantly reduced overall code complexity and effectively handled all possible cases of sentence conversion.
